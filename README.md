# Surgical_Scene_Reconstructor
This is a program to achieve 3D reconstruction of the surgical scene from multiple camera viewpoints

Next Action Items:
1. camera grouping
2. merge intra and inter matching pair results
3. use descriptors instead of feature points (for cross camera matching?)
4. compute 3D position from 2D rays (points)
5. Fit the 3D,2Ds pairs into the data structure...
6. More thoughts on 3D and 2D points data structure
7. (optional) test code for other steps like: camera combination result... matching... (or we can also do it in separate script)

Archived:
1. Rough think through for 3D and 2D points data structure
2. Camera combinations from camera groups
3. include relation plot for .h files
